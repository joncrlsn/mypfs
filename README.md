# mypfs
An personal fileserver for quickly sharing files with (and receiving files from) other computers on your network. More specifically, it is a small web server that exposes the files in the current directory and/or allows uploads to the same directory.

### why?
* Me: Sarah, can you send me that 100MB zip of those log files?
* Sarah: Sure, I'll attach it to an email
* Me: Um, our email system doesn't allow attachments over 10MB
* Sarah: OK, do you have a flash drive?
* Me: No, that's such a pain.
* (I start mypfs)
* Me: Here, open your browser to `http://<my-internal-ip-address>:8080`, enter this username when requested, and upload the file
* (30 seconds later)
* Sarah: That was easy.

### features
1. mypfs provides an HTTP web interface to upload/download files to/from the current directory
1. access to the web interface requires a username that is randomly generated during server startup (a password is not needed)
1. runs on the command-line
1. during startup you can specify upload, download, or accept the default of both
1. server will run for 10 minutes (default), then exit -- (this is a security feature which gives enough time to exchange files and yet protect you if you forget to shut it off)

### examples
* `mypfs --timeout=5 --port=8888`  (both upload and download)
* `mypfs -t5 -p8888 download`   (just download)
* `mypfs upload`  (just upload)
* `mypfs --insecure`  (wide open to anyone)

### how to install and run
1. download executable for your platform ( [windows](https://github.com/joncrlsn/mypfs/raw/master/bin-win/mypfs.exe "Windows"), [osx](https://github.com/joncrlsn/mypfs/raw/master/bin-osx/mypfs "OSX"), [linux](https://github.com/joncrlsn/mypfs/raw/master/bin-linux/mypfs "Linux") )
1. place executable somewhere in your path
1. navigate to the directory with files you want to share 
1. run `mypfs`
1. share URL and generated username with person you need to exchange files with. 

### safe use
1. mypfs will work over the internet only if your computer has a public IP address or you have port-forwarding setup on your router.
1. run mypfs in a small directory, never the root or home directory
1. avoid use on a public network (like a coffeeshop) until more security features are added
1. avoid extending the timeout unless you totally trust your network
1. shut it down after you have exchanged files

### version history
1. 0.9.4 listens on IPV4 addresses (no IPV6... couldn't get both); startup displays URL to share
1. 0.9.3 secret username is now optional with the --insecure (-k) flag
1. 0.9.2 a secret username is generated -- required to access the site 
1. 0.9.1 log to standard out when someone downloads or uploads a file
1. 0.9.0 first release

### cool things that could be added
1. add parameter with directory to be served  i.e. `mypfs upload /tmp/share`
1. on the web pages, show time remaining until server shuts down
1. instead of exiting after timeout, show a "timeout" page
1. support https (easy with GoLang, just not sure it will be used)
1. limit uploads to a configurable amount
